THINGS THAT NEED FIXING
[X] HELPER TOGGLE WILL TURN OFF ALL FUNCTIONALITY (SELECTION ETC);
[X] Intersection slightly off from mouse position -- Fixed by changing camera far frustum to a larger value (30000) and aspect ratio to 90
[X] Fix Multi select for lines
[X] Fix node importation (why is it broke??) 
[X] Fix node multiple selection
[ ] Selection sometimes doesn't change geometry colour to white (might have something to do with document loading as this bug appears to happen if selection happens immediately?)
[X] Vegetation broken? (Was broken due to the if statements running it as a LIMIT 200 instead of LIMIT 5, although interestingly discovered you can change the max MB of PHP data transfer)
[ ] Camera messes up at large distances and doesn't let you zoom back in fully (Will have to try to recreate this bug...)
[X] Helper still appears on invisible objects (Fixed by making sure intersection only occurs on visible items)
[X] Selection still works on invisible items (Should be fixed as selection is based on valid intersections (DOUBLE CHECK THIS!))
[ ] Helper appearing in middle instead of on top of object
[ ] Hole Triangulation (ST_Dump might be a fix?)
